Hello I'm django07 and I've been on discord for 3 and a half years.
I'm a bot developer and I own 6 Minecraft servers and I own a roblox airline business.
I like cats and animals and I do flight simulating stuff but my pc is too bad to get MSFS :( so I just use the browser version of geoFS lol.
I'm mostly active on my phone, I will probably reply to a message within the same day or the next day, but I'm banned from my pc most of the time lol

You can reach me at discord, my tag is django07  🐈#3333
